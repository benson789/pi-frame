 in a generation where you respect it big
 time and
 so you were glad
 that he was on your
 side
 there's no two ways about it
 me a little bit more about the actual
 filming aspect of
 zed kai's
 of the early days David Rose who was the producer thought it would be
 far more edgy to do it live
 so
 it actually was transmitted
 live
 now this doesn't happen
 very often
 I believe EastEnders has had a live
 episode which is amazing
 but yeah in those days they did actually
 transmit live so it was quite
 difficult well your dad's obviously a man of many talents isn't he because I mean he's actually
 produced an album down
 here yeah
 brilliant so he had
 a great singing voice
 beautiful voice
 absolutely beautiful
 voice but he produced this record
 I don't think the
 picture does it justice
 no it's a bit
 harsh looking but
 some beautiful beautiful
 songs on there
 so yeah I remember it well and you've
 brought along a script yeah
 because my mother was also an actress and
 she always played
 Mrs.
 Barlow because if there was a scene at a bed scene,
 now that's very normal, they woke him up in the middle of the night so he had to be lying down with his
 wife it was always mum but she also
 played sort
 of other parts and this was her rehearsal script
 She was a sleeping partner as well. She was literally.
 amazing. I've got to say that
 you know
 things they just don't turn up
 at
 auction so if if I've got to put a value on this
 if we've got the right
 enthusiasts there I wouldn't be surprised
 to see it make up to
 Â£500.
 spiky
 Well that's amazing.
 Well listen thank you so much. Thank you. Brilliant pleasure. Thank you.
 put out our call for stories we were
 delighted when we heard from the
 daughter of the man who wrote
 this famous
 theme. Monty you are responsible for
 what I
 think is the most
 iconic theme tune of them
 all, which is the James Bond theme tune. Thank you.
 And he wrote
 it for a musical originally that never got made.
 Yes.
 So how did you come to use
 this piece of music for
 the Bond movies?
 Because I
 worked several
 times with
 Cubby
 Broccoli, the producer of the Bond movies.
 producers, and
 just acquired the rights of the James Bond novels from
 Ian Fleming.
 The first one he was going to do
 was be
 Dr. No and he wanted me to
 write the music.
 And what was it about the
 theme tune that
 you already
 had that you thought you
 could adapt to
 the Bond movies? Well, what
 I did was
 I dug it
 out and I
 played it and sang
 it to myself.
 Anyway, I
 was born
 with
 this unlucky sneeze
 and what is
 worse, I
 came into
 and so on.
 Nothing like it.
 And I suddenly
 realised
 that the way to do
 this is
 to split the notes.
 So
 instead of
 became... Well the moment I heard that, I knew I
 was onto it.
 It
 had everything I
 wanted for James
 Bond. And ruthlessness and sexiness.
 and everything else.
 So looking
 at your
 manuscript
 here, looking at the notes...
