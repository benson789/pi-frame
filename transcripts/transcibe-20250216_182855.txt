 Because it was
 quite at the time. It was quite an unusual way to wear your hair. Yeah, it was an
 interesting
 character. Well
 Interesting story,
 amazing memory for you, an amazing day.
 Yeah, really.
 Doubt of value.
 We've got
 this poster which
 is fairly iconic.

 original, but this is the poster.
 And the unsigned poster
 is just a poster for an exhibition.

 with the Andy Warhol signature.
 and I presume the Kimiko
 Powers signature in Japanese.
 That's right.
 Four.
 Three to
 four thousand.
 Really?
 Wow.
 The Interview
 Magazine, signed by Andy
 Warhol, I'd say
 a thousand pounds.
 This photograph I'm sure
 is by Lee
 Black-Charter. He was a
 fascinating guy, I think, from Kansas originally. Worked in a brothel. Great.
 All the reception. It
 fits perfectly. Crazy guy, I miss him.
 And I'm
 sure I went to an exhibition of
 his photographs recently.
 And a photograph like that. Andy
 Warhol in a wig.
 Beautiful woman standing
 behind him. I
 still think
 that's 500 pounds.
 to a thousand.
 This fits in
 with his
 idea of what
 art was.
 That art could be
 anything. Even if it was commercial. The soup tins.
 The dollar bills.
 Whatever.
 So I think this is really
 iconic Andy Warhol.
 And I
 would value
 this with
 your
 story and him wanting
 to sign everything you
 were wearing.
 I put this up.
 £5,000.
 Oh my God.
 I'm going to cry.
 Collective value all

 Thank you.
 Amazing.
 Thank you.
 Next, Eric
 Knowles meets the
 daughter of a well-loved
 British
 actor.
 Well, I need to introduce your
 father, but before I
 do, just tell me his name.
 Alan Stratford
-Jones.
 Okay, Alan Stratford
-Jones, but we know him better
 as Stratford
-Johns, do we not?
 OK, well, listen, here comes a visual introduction for the benefit of those who may not have been around in 1963.
 The country's going up, these
 new estates
 in Newtown, what shall we
 went back to plague on the thieves, Danaways, and the villains.
 Now
 if P.C. gets murdered, why block him back?
 You should have married somebody who understood CRD work.
 With previous police heroes, I mean, before that was Jack Warner. Jack Warner is all nice and cosy, was Dixon
 or Doc
 Green, but I tell you what, when Zed Carzer and I talk about nitty-gritty, and your dad just fitted the bill, and I'm not here to be patronizing, I'm here to tell you, you know, what I was
 thinking, because if ever
 there was a
 detective
 inspector you didn't want to be interrogated
 by, it was,
 yes, Charlie
 Barlow.
 But tell me a little bit
 more about your
 dad, because, I
 mean, I
 honestly thought that Stratford was his
 first name. No, his first name was Alan, and he was, in fact, born in South Africa.
 He came to this country when he
 was
 21, and his surname
 was, in fact,
 Johnson, so it was Alan Johnson.
