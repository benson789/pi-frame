 Where are we?
 EastEnders, of course. We're privileged to have Albert Square as our backdrop for this entertainment special. Yes, we'll hear from the stars of
 EastEnders over a
 tickle in the Queen Vic.
 Meet
 unsung heroes behind
 famous movies
 like Star
 Wars, as well as
 meet fans of
 stage, screen
 and music legends.
 I think we
 can
 guarantee a nostalgic
 feast as we turn the spotlight
 onto
 showbiz on
 tonight's Antiques Roadshow.
 Well, I've got the
 privilege of introducing one of the earliest heroes of
 my life.
 So, without any further ado...
 We want nothing!
 nothing but
 MuleðŸŽµ ðŸŽµBearer Muffin mayðŸŽµ
 ðŸŽµPoppin'ðŸŽµ
 you're here at
 last. So, the star of the show...
 and you are Will
 McNally.
 And tell me, Will, what is your association with
 this
 fabulous mule? Well, it was my grandparents who owned and worked
 him back in the 40s
 and
 50s and through into the 60s, I suppose. I mean, was he always
 called Muffin the Mule? Well, well, no. He was actually made in 1933, so as a
 puppet. He's 84 years
 old this year. And it was when my
 grandparents, who were Anne Hogarth and Jan Bustle, and they were well-renowned puppeteers of the Hogarth puppets, and they were touring around the country in a caravan
 that converted to a puppet theatre.
 And they were doing their
 shows, and they found that they were five, ten
 minutes short in their length.
 so they needed something else. So one night my grandfather
 was there and
 he
 decided on a kicking mule.
 And the kicking mule was the come on at the end of the puppet circus and sort of
 shoo and
 shibby the
 clowns off the stage.
 chasing them around this way and that. And it
 all went down very well.
 And the
 audiences loved it.
 But after a
 while my grandparents grew
 a little bit bored of it. Yeah.
 And they
 decided to cut that
 part of the act out of the show.
 And so my grandpa
 was working for the BBC as a producer. And he met Annette Mills.
 And Annette Mills wanted to do a
 programme for
 children singing songs at the piano.
 And she wanted something to
 go on the piano
 top to help
 illustrate the songs.
 So she approached my grandfather and said.
 oh Jan, would you make me
 a puppet?
 And he thought, why
 don't you come round to my house and select
 one of my puppets?
 friends?
 Well, Annette fortunately thought that was a great
 idea, so she went round to her house the very next day and selected the kicking mule and named him Muffin Mule.
 Wonderful. And
 that's Renette Milters, who by the way was the sister of the fondle.
 We got a photograph of her way back at the BBC at her piano with Muffin
 in full flow.
 and you can see
 your grandparents up there.
 That's right.
 Well, and it
 was the face that
 everyone
 knows, you know, because she was the one on
 TV. But it was my grandmother who
 worked Muffin.
 my grandfather worked the others and he was the
 TV
 producer and director of the
 shows back in those days.
 This is a program that lasted until
 1955, am I right to say? That's right. So tell
 me, where's he stable these days?
 Oh, back home with me
 and Devon. But he's
 never out of retirement, is he?
 No, we
 go around and we do a few
 presentations here
 and
 there and I'm hoping I'm not going to
 able to get back on TV one day.
 Well, you know, I've got to value this fellow. I
 mean, how do
 you value a
 TV icon? It's really, really difficult. Now, I should point out for the benefit of the viewers
 that there are a lot
 of Muffin the Mules out
 there which are made from a die-cast metal.
 That's right. I mean,
 they produce thousands of them and they do turn up with a certain amount of
 regularity on the
 road show. They certainly do.
 What we're looking at here
 is much
 larger in scale and
 is the original.
 He is the original.
 He is the
 one and
 only that was made in
 1933.
 I will give you
 a
 modest, a modest guess to that.
 He's
 worth at least Â£5,000.
 I'm tempted to open in the bidding to all these
 people
 here and see where we go.
 Thank you so much.
 This sounds a bit
 silly but, despite the
 years, I still want to kiss
 this fellow. Do you mind if
 I come in?
 Come in. I've missed you too.
 Mmm.
 You can call
 me bonkers, I don't care.
 care.
 Oh.
